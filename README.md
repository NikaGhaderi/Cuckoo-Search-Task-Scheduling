# Real-Time Task Scheduling on Multi-Core Processors

## Overview
This project focuses on scheduling a set of real-time tasks on multi-core processors to minimize the makespan and optimize load balancing. The scheduling is achieved using two algorithms: Cuckoo Search and Genetic Algorithm. The project includes the generation of synthetic periodic tasks using the UUNIFAST algorithm.

## Objectives
- Minimize the makespan of task scheduling.
- Optimize load balancing across multiple cores.
- Compare the performance of Cuckoo Search and Genetic Algorithm in task scheduling.

## Project Phases
### Phase 1: Task Generation and Scheduling
- Generate tasks using the UUNIFAST algorithm.
- Schedule tasks using the Genetic Algorithm.
- Analyze and visualize the results.

### Phase 2: Cuckoo Search Scheduling
- Schedule the generated tasks using the Cuckoo Search algorithm.
- Compare the results of Cuckoo Search with those of the Genetic Algorithm.

## Features
- Task generation with execution time, deadlines, and utilization.
- Visualization of scheduling results, including:
  - Quality of Service (QoS) metrics.
  - Makespan for different scenarios.
  - Core utilization.
  - Task schedulability.
- Comprehensive report with code explanations and analysis of results.
